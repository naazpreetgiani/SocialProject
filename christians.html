    <p>Christianity is a monotheistic religion that centers on the teachings of Jesus Christ, the son of the “god almighty”. It is believed that through faith and Jesus Christ that people have access to god and the afterlife. The Christian religion began in the mid-first century CE, and first made its appearance in Judea. What was known about Christianity came from the four gospels; the gospels hold that Jesus was born in the first decade BC in Judea. Jesus was known to be flawlessly conceived by his father, Joseph. Jesus was believed to have worked as a carpenter from a young age, but by the age of thirty, he took upon preaching forgiveness; he specifically preached that in forgiving others for their sins, you would gain righteousness. But, the Jewish and Roman leaders at the time believed Jesus to be subversive, and had him arrested and crucified as he was nailed to a wooden cross and left to die. The legend of Jesus did not end there, according to the gospels, his body is known to have been resurrected by his father (god). Paul the Apostle, a Greek speaking jew, claimed that God revealed Jesus Christ to him in a vision, this led Paul to make it his mission to assemble Christianity as a religion by establishing churches across the Roman Empire. Over the next two millenia, Christianity would grow and scriptures would be gathered and translated to form the Bible. The rise of Christianity put the idea of equality in people’s heads. This differed from the Roman Empire which consisted of a social hierarchy where slaves were owned and controlled by monarchs. As Christianity grew, it became punishable to believe in the old gods, this put an end to polytheism. The christian era was a movement towards faith, because there was a religious transformation from polytheism to monotheism. There was also a wide-spread of the Christian religion with establishment of churches throughout many territories, this spread caused a significant growth in the Christian religion, therefore an increase in overall faith.</p>
