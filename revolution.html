    <h1>The Scientific Revolution</h1>

    <p>Began at the end of the Renaissance to the end of the late 18th century. A period of scientific revolution during the early modern period where great progressions were made in areas such as astronomy, mathematics, technology, philosophy and biology( including anatomy). Some of the scientific discoveries of this period include Sir Isaac Newton, one of the key figures of this age, discovering gravity. This finding became the anchor for many other discoveries that would later be made, such as gravitational formulas in physics and proving heliocentric ideas in astronomy. Ideas from the Middle ages based on faith( eg. Aristotle) were challenged and proven through science and rationality. Copernicus, Galileo and Newton developed new concepts on the universe based on science and natural laws instead of the will of god. As it was primarily an intellectual movement, emphasis started being put on confirmation of data as it was no longer suitable to simply publish information in an overpriced book. Belief in god and superstitions was replaced by reliance on reason and evidence.The scientific revolution is farther along towards the age of reason due to its discoveries and ideas of reason beyond faith, however some groups were still bound by ideas from the age of faith. Women were still bound by traditional roles and views while the scientific discoveries being made were still being questioned and evaluated at the time.</p>
