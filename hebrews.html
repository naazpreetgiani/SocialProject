    <p>The Hebrews were the first people to create a kingdom in the Ancient land of Cannan, they were one of the most important cultures of the Western World at the time. What set Hebrews apart from the Greeks, and Romans was their religion. Judaism, which was heavily practiced at the time, proved to be important throughout world history. Judaism is one of the oldest monotheistic faiths, the central principle is the belief in one god as the creator of the universe. Jews believed that everyone could have a personal and individual relationship with God. Additionally, a main belief is that God continues to work in the world, affecting everything that people do.  Judaism originated with the biblical patriarch Abraham (approx 1800 BCE). Abraham established a covalent or special agreement with God, which was confirmed with the reception of the Torah (Hebrew Bible). It is said that God gave Abraham instructions to follow around 4000 years ago.  Jews believed that god would look out/offer protection to them therefore, acts of worship were done daily.  Since religion was so prevalent, Jews brought holiness to everything they did by praising acts of god and honouring everything god had done. For most people, much of their life became acts of worship. Judaism was a movement towards faith, due to how important religion was at the time and how it affected everyday life. </p>
